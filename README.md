# neodym IDE (alpha)

With the neodym IDE it is possible to easily create app projects using the [Ionic SDK](http://ionicframework.com). A lot of built in and automatically configured tools help to improve your code quality and speed up most of the manual steps coming along with developing an app. A lot of functionality is bundled in an user interface to guarantee comfortable and fast usage.
