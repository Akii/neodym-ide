# neodym IDE (alpha)

With the neodym IDE it is possible to easily create app projects using the [Ionic SDK](http://ionicframework.com). A lot of built in and automatically configured tools help to improve your code quality and speed up most of the manual steps coming along with developing an app.

## Functionality

### Create a new app project including all configuration
A new app project can easily be created by entering a name and a target directory as well as selecting a predefined Ionic template. Afterwards a template including all setup and configuration files will be downloaded and all dependencies will automatically be installed.

### Switch between your app projects
In the project overview all app projects created with neodym are listed and can be opened to work on them.

### Edit your app settings
Editing your settings is now possible via interface.

### Manage your components easily via interface
Lots of components need to be created to implement the app logic within the source code. Building up a basic structure often needs a lot of time. Therefore the component manager will be introduced. It allows to create/edit and delete components as comfortable as possible. As neodym IDE tries to support you with testing, each created component also generates a matching test file. 

### Run often used tasks and create new tasks
A lot of tasks need to be run very often. This always needs manual command prompt input and also requires remembering the commands. With neodym this gets replaced by the task manager which comes with predefined basic tasks or allows to customize tasks yourself. Each task can be started (and stopped) via click.

### Check your code quality by running a code analysis powered by JSHint
To get some hints on syntax errors, possible bugs or violating some conventions the code analysis manager helps to run JSHint and displays the results. 

### Manage your libraries

### Search for plugins and manage them easily using the plugin manager
Maintaining plugins via the command prompt is really hard and time consuming. That's why we built a plugin manager which provides an overview about all installed plugins and tells you which plugin can be updated. Also searching for plugins and installing or uninstalling them via click is possible. 

### Run your tests and have a look at your code coverage

### Release your app easily

## Installation

The [Ionic SDK](http://ionicframework.com) has to be successfully installed and configured to use neodym. If you are not familiar with Ionic, please have a look at its [official documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/).

Afterwards you only need to download the .zip package and start the neodym-ide.exe to run the IDE.

## Dependencies

Code analysis is powered by JSHint.
Karma is used as the test runner.
Jasmine is used as the testing framework.
